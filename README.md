E-SHOP | Advanced HTML5 & CSS3 Project
A professional, multi-page eCommerce website built to demonstrate advanced CSS capabilities without the use of JavaScript or external frameworks.

🚀 Key Features

Pure CSS State Management: Includes an interactive pricing toggle using the "Checkbox Hack" to switch between plans.


Modern Layouts: Utilizes CSS Grid for product catalogs and Flexbox for navigation and the "About" section layouts.



Mobile-First Design: A fully responsive architecture with strategic breakpoints for all device sizes.


No-JS Form Styling: Features a contact form with native CSS validation states for professional user feedback.

🛠️ Techniques Used

Modular CSS Architecture: Styles are organized into main.css, layout.css, and animations.css for better maintainability.


Advanced Selectors: Extensive use of pseudo-elements and sibling combinators for interactivity without scripts.


Transitions & Animations: Custom keyframe animations and smooth hover transitions enhance the visual experience.

🧠 Challenges Faced

The "No-JS" Constraint: Implementing a functional pricing switch required using the :checked pseudo-class and sibling combinators (~) to toggle visibility and styles.


Complex Layouts: Balancing CSS Grid for 2D product grids while using Flexbox for the 1D alternating "About" sections to ensure perfect responsiveness.


Semantic Accessibility: Ensuring that the custom CSS interactive elements remained accessible and followed a semantic HTML structure.
